# PURPOSE: This is a *hints* file to help guide students in creating the 
#          function classify_images that uses the classifier function 
#          to create the classifier labels and then compares the classifier 
#          labels to the pet image labels. This function inputs:
#            -The Image Folder as image_dir within classify_images and function 
#             and as in_arg.dir for function call within main. 
#            -The results dictionary as results_dic within classify_images 
#             function and results for the functin call within main.
#            -The CNN model architecture as model wihtin classify_images function
#             and in_arg.arch for the function call within main. 
#           This function uses the extend function to add items to the list 
#           that's the 'value' of the results dictionary. You will be adding the
#           classifier label as the item at index 1 of the list and the comparison 
#           of the pet and classifier labels as the item at index 2 of the list.

# TODO 3: EDIT and ADD code BELOW to do the following that's stated in the 
#       comments below that start with "TODO: 3" for the classify_images function 
#       Specifically EDIT and ADD code to define the classify_images function. 
#       Notice that this function doesn't return anything because the 
#       results_dic dictionary that is passed into the function is a mutable 
#       data type so no return is needed.
